## 1. What Is Hubitat Dashboard?

Hubitat Dashboard is a custom control panel for your **Hubitat Elevation** smart home hub.
It shows your devices as tiles — small buttons or status displays — organized into groups that you define.

- The **web app** runs on a Windows PC on your home network and is viewed in any browser.
- The **Android app** runs on your phone or tablet and connects to your hub directly.

Both apps let you:
- See the live status of every device on your hub (switches, sensors, locks, lights, etc.)
- Control devices by tapping their tiles
- Organize devices into named groups and subgroups that make sense for *your* home
- View hub variables (custom data values your hub tracks, like sunrise/sunset times)
- View and control the Hub Security Manager (HSM) and hub mode

Neither app requires any paid subscription or cloud service. Everything runs on your local home network.

---

## 2. Before You Begin — Hubitat Maker API Setup

The Hubitat Maker API is a built-in feature of your Hubitat hub that lets third-party apps (like this dashboard) read and control your devices. **You must set this up before running the dashboard for the first time.**

### 2.1 Enable the Maker API App

1. Open a web browser and go to your Hubitat hub's web interface.
   - The address is usually something like `http://192.168.1.x` — your hub's IP address.
   - If you don't know the IP address, look at your router's connected devices list, or check the sticker on the back of the hub.
2. Click **Apps** in the left menu.
3. Click **Add Built-In App**.
4. Find **Maker API** in the list and click it.
5. The Maker API is now installed. Click **Maker API** in your Apps list to open its settings.

### 2.2 Authorize Your Devices

The Maker API will only expose the devices you explicitly allow.

1. In the Maker API settings page, find the section labeled **"Select which devices to allow access to"** (or similar wording).
2. Click in that field and select every device you want to see in the dashboard.
   - You can include all of them — it is safe to do so.
   - Any device you skip will not appear in the dashboard at all.
3. Check the box for **"Allow Access via Local Network"** — this is required for the dashboard to communicate with your hub.
4. If you want the Android app to also work away from home, check **"Allow Access via Cloud"** as well.
5. Click **Done** or **Update** to save.

### 2.3 Authorize Hub Variables

Hub variables are custom data values you have created in Hubitat (for example: Sunrise time, Sunset time, weather report text, custom flags). The dashboard can display these as tiles, but the Maker API must be told which variables it is allowed to share.

1. On the Maker API settings page, scroll down to find the section labeled **"Hub Variables"** or **"Select which Hub Variables to share"**.
2. Click in that field and select every variable you want to display in the dashboard.
   - If you have no hub variables, you can skip this step.
   - Common examples: `Sunrise`, `Sunset`, `CivilDusk`, `AstronomicalDusk`, `WeatherReport`
3. Click **Done** or **Update** to save.

> **Important:** If you add new hub variables later, you must return to the Maker API settings and authorize them before they will appear in the dashboard.

### 2.4 Find Your Connection Details

You need three pieces of information from the Maker API settings page. Write them down — you will enter them during setup.

| What you need | Where to find it | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Hub IP Address** | The address bar when you're on the hub's web interface, or listed on the Maker API page | `192.168.1.42` |
| **Maker App ID** | Shown on the Maker API settings page, labeled "App ID" | `123` |
| **Access Token** | Shown on the Maker API settings page, labeled "Access Token" | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| **Cloud Hub ID** *(Android only, for away-from-home access)* | On the Maker API page under "Cloud Access" | `606cf154-46af-4877-adb4-680b40e940c0` |

---

## 3. Web App — Windows Setup

### 3.1 Install Node.js

The web app requires a free program called **Node.js** to run. This is a one-time install.

1. Open your web browser and go to: **https://nodejs.org**
2. Click the large button that says **"LTS"** (recommended for most users) to download the installer.
3. Run the installer. Accept all the defaults — just keep clicking **Next** and then **Install**.
4. When it finishes, click **Finish**.

To verify it installed correctly:
1. Press the **Windows key + R**, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open a Command Prompt window.
2. Type the following and press Enter:
   ```
   node --version
   ```
3. You should see a version number like `v20.x.x`. If you do, Node.js is ready.

### 3.2 Get the Dashboard Files

You need the dashboard files on your computer.

**Option A — Download a ZIP (easiest)**
1. Go to the project's GitHub page in your browser.
2. Click the green **Code** button, then click **Download ZIP**.
3. When the download finishes, right-click the ZIP file and choose **Extract All**.
4. Choose a convenient location, for example `C:\HubitatDashboard`.
5. Click **Extract**.

**Option B — Clone with Git** *(only if you already know what Git is)*
```
git clone https://github.com/tibrown/HubitatDashboard.git C:\HubitatDashboard
```

All instructions below assume you placed the files in `C:\HubitatDashboard`. If you chose a different folder, substitute that path wherever you see `C:\HubitatDashboard`.

### 3.3 Configure the Backend

The backend is the part of the web app that talks to your hub. It needs to know your hub's address and access token.

1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to `C:\HubitatDashboard\backend`.
2. You will see a file called `config.json.example`.
3. **Copy** that file (right-click → Copy) and **paste** it in the same folder.
4. **Rename** the copy to `config.json` (right-click → Rename).
5. Right-click `config.json` and open it with **Notepad** (or any text editor).
6. The file will look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "hubIP": "192.168.1.xxx",
     "makerAppId": "123",
     "accessToken": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
     "backendPort": 3001,
     "pinHash": "$2b$10$...",
     "postUrl": "http://<THIS_SERVER_IP>:3001/api/webhook",
     "hubUsername": "",
     "hubPassword": ""
   }
   ```
7. Replace the placeholder values with the details you wrote down in [Section 2.4](#24-find-your-connection-details):
   - Change `192.168.1.xxx` to your hub's actual IP address.
   - Change `123` to your Maker App ID.
   - Change the `accessToken` value to your Access Token.
   - Replace `<THIS_SERVER_IP>` in the `postUrl` with the IP address of **the Windows computer** that will run the dashboard (not the hub). You can find your PC's IP address by opening Command Prompt and typing `ipconfig` — look for the line that says "IPv4 Address".
   - Leave `pinHash`, `hubUsername`, and `hubPassword` as-is for now (or delete the pinHash line if you don't want PIN protection).
8. Save the file (Ctrl+S) and close Notepad.

**Example of a filled-in config.json:**
```json
{
  "hubIP": "192.168.1.42",
  "makerAppId": "155",
  "accessToken": "a1b2c3d4-1234-5678-abcd-ef0123456789",
  "backendPort": 3001,
  "postUrl": "http://192.168.1.100:3001/api/webhook",
  "hubUsername": "",
  "hubPassword": ""
}
```

#### Set up the Webhook (Optional but recommended for live updates)

The webhook allows your hub to push device state changes to the dashboard instantly, so tiles update in real time without needing to refresh.

1. Go back to your Hubitat hub's web interface.
2. Open **Apps → Maker API**.
3. Find the field labeled **"Post URL"** or **"Webhook URL"**.
4. Enter the value from the `postUrl` line in your config.json.
   For example: `http://192.168.1.100:3001/api/webhook`
5. Click **Update** or **Done**.

### 3.4 Install Dependencies and Start the Dashboard

You only need to do the "install" step once. After that, use `start.ps1` every time.

**First-time install:**
1. Press **Windows key + X** and choose **Windows PowerShell** (or **Terminal**).
2. Navigate to the dashboard folder by typing:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\HubitatDashboard
   ```
   and pressing Enter.
3. Type the following and press Enter. This downloads the software libraries the app needs:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
   This may take a minute or two. You will see a lot of text scroll by — that is normal. Wait for it to finish.

**Starting the dashboard (every time):**
1. Open PowerShell (as above).
2. Navigate to the dashboard folder:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\HubitatDashboard
   ```
3. Type and press Enter:
   ```powershell
   .\start.ps1
   ```
   > If you get a message about "execution policy", type the following first, press Enter, type `Y` when asked, then try `.\start.ps1` again:
   > ```powershell
   > Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
   > ```
4. Two new windows will open — one for the backend, one for the frontend. Leave them open.
5. Open your web browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173**
6. The dashboard will appear. 🎉

### 3.5 Stop the Dashboard

1. Open PowerShell in the dashboard folder (as above).
2. Type and press Enter:
   ```powershell
   .\stop.ps1
   ```
3. Both service windows will close.

Alternatively, just close both PowerShell windows that opened when you ran `start.ps1`.

### 3.6 Security Warning — Local Use Only

> ⚠️ **This dashboard is designed to run ONLY on your home network.**
>
> The web app has **no login, no password, and no encryption**. Anyone on your local network who knows the address (`http://localhost:5173` or your PC's IP address on port 5173) can see and control your devices.
>
> **Do not expose this dashboard to the internet.** Do not port-forward or publish this address outside your home. It is intended only for personal use on your private Wi-Fi network.

---

## 4. Web App — First-Time Use

### 4.1 Scan Your Devices

The first time you open the dashboard, it has no groups configured. The first thing you should do is scan your hub to load all of your devices.

1. Open the dashboard in your browser (`http://localhost:5173`).
2. Look at the left sidebar. You will see a settings or menu icon — click it to open the sidebar.
3. Click the **Scan** or **Refresh Devices** button. The app will contact your hub and load every device you authorized in the Maker API.

### 4.2 The "All Devices" Group

After scanning, the dashboard creates one built-in group called **"All Devices"** (sometimes shown as **"Other"**). This group automatically contains every device that was found on your hub but has not yet been placed in a custom group.

Think of it as a holding area — a complete inventory of everything the hub knows about. From here, you will gradually move devices into organized groups that make sense for your home.

> **Tip:** The "All Devices" group can get large. That is okay. As you create your own groups and add devices to them, those devices will be removed from "All Devices" automatically.

---

## 5. Web App — Building Your Dashboard

### 5.1 Creating a Custom Group

Groups are pages in the sidebar that hold related tiles. You might make a group called "Living Room", "Garage", "Security", etc.

1. In the sidebar, look for a **"+"** or **"New Group"** button and click it.
2. A dialog box will appear. Type a name for your group (for example: `Living Room`).
3. Choose an icon from the icon grid by clicking on one. The icon will appear next to your group's name in the sidebar.
4. Click **Create Group**.
5. Your new empty group will appear in the sidebar. Click it to open it.

### 5.2 Adding Devices to a Group

Once you're viewing a group, you can add device tiles to it.

1. Open the group you want to add devices to by clicking its name in the sidebar.
2. Look for an **Edit** mode button (often a pencil icon ✏️ or "Edit" label) in the top-right area of the page. Click it to enter edit mode.
   - In edit mode, you will see buttons to add, remove, and rearrange tiles.
3. Click the **"Add Device"** button (usually a **+** symbol or labeled "Add Tile").
4. A picker panel will appear showing a searchable list of all your devices.
   - At the top of the list you will see **Special Tiles** — these include Hub Mode, Security System (HSM), and time-based tiles like Sunrise and Sunset. See [Section 5.5](#55-special-tiles) for details.
   - Below that is the full list of your devices, sorted alphabetically.
5. You can type in the **Search** box to filter the list.
   - Try searching by room ("kitchen"), device type ("motion"), or device name ("front door").
6. Click on any device to add it to the group. The picker will close and the tile will appear.
7. Repeat for as many devices as you want to add to this group.
8. When finished, click the **Edit** button again (or a **Done** button if shown) to exit edit mode.

> **A device can appear in more than one group.** For example, "Front Door Lock" might appear in both a "Locks" group and a "Front Entryway" group. There is no restriction.

### 5.3 Subgroups

A subgroup is a group that lives *inside* another group. This is useful for organizing large groups into sections. For example:

- **Security** *(main group)*
  - **Motion Sensors** *(subgroup)*
  - **Door & Window Contacts** *(subgroup)*
  - **Cameras** *(subgroup)*

To create a subgroup (web):
1. Follow the steps in [Section 5.1](#51-creating-a-custom-group) to create a new group.
2. After typing the group name and choosing an icon, look for a **"Parent Group"** dropdown menu in the dialog.
3. Click the dropdown and choose the group that should contain this new subgroup.
4. Click **Create Group**.

The new subgroup will appear nested under its parent in the sidebar.

> **Note:** Subgroups work the same as regular groups — you can add devices to them, rename them, etc. The only difference is how they are displayed in the navigation.

### 5.4 Rearranging and Removing Tiles

While in **edit mode**:

- **To move a tile:** Click and drag it to a new position within the group.
- **To remove a tile:** Look for a small **X** or **Remove** button that appears on each tile in edit mode. Click it to remove that tile from the group.
  - Removing a tile from a group does *not* delete the device from the hub — it only removes it from this group's view.

### 5.5 Special Tiles

In addition to regular devices, you can add several **special tiles** to any group:

| Tile | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Hub Mode** | The current mode of your Hubitat hub (e.g., Home, Away, Night). Tap to change the mode. |
| **Hub Security Manager (HSM)** | The status of the built-in alarm/security system. Tap to arm or disarm. |
| **Sunrise** | The time of today's sunrise (from a hub variable). |
| **Sunset** | The time of today's sunset. |
| **Civil Dusk** | The time of civil dusk (slightly after sunset). |
| **Full Dark** | The time of astronomical dusk (full darkness). |
| **Weather Report** | A text summary if you have a weather hub variable set up. |

These appear at the top of the device picker under "Special Tiles".

> **Hub variables must be authorized in Maker API** (see [Section 2.3](#23-authorize-hub-variables)) for these tiles to display data. If a hub variable tile shows "—" or blank, check that the variable is authorized and spelled correctly.

---

## 6. Web App — Settings

Click the **Settings** (gear icon ⚙️) in the sidebar to open the Settings panel.

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Idle Auto-Refresh** | Automatically reloads the dashboard after N minutes of no activity. Set to `0` to disable. Useful if the dashboard is shown on a wall-mounted screen. |
| **Hub File Manager Credentials** | Only needed if you have **Hub Security** (login/password) enabled on your Hubitat hub. Used for the Push/Pull config sync feature. Leave blank if you haven't enabled hub security. |

---

## 7. Android App — Installing the APK (Sideloading)

The Hubitat Dashboard Android app is not on the Google Play Store. Instead, you install it by **sideloading** — manually transferring the APK file to your phone and installing it. This is safe and common for personal apps.

### 7.1 Step 1 — Get the APK File

1. The APK file is named something like `hubitat-dashboard-debug.apk` or `app-debug.apk`.
2. It will be provided to you by whoever built the app, or you can find it in the project files under `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
3. Save it somewhere easy to find on your Windows PC (for example, your Desktop).

### 7.2 Step 2 — Upload to Google Drive

1. On your Windows PC, open a web browser and go to **https://drive.google.com**.
2. Sign in with your Google account.
3. Click **+ New** in the top-left, then choose **File upload**.
4. Browse to the APK file (e.g., your Desktop) and click **Open**.
5. Wait for the upload to finish. The APK will now appear in your Google Drive.

### 7.3 Step 3 — Download to Your Phone

1. On your **Android phone**, open the **Google Drive** app.
   - If you don't have it, download it from the Play Store — it's free.
2. Find the APK file you just uploaded.
3. Tap the **three dots (⋮)** next to the APK filename.
4. Tap **Download**.
5. The file will be saved to your phone's Downloads folder.

### 7.4 Step 4 — Install with the Files App

Android does not allow installing apps from unknown sources by default. You will be prompted to allow it once.

1. Open the **Files** app on your phone.
   - On most Android phones this is called **Files by Google**, **My Files**, or just **Files**.
   - If you can't find it, search for "Files" in your app drawer.
2. Navigate to **Downloads** (or the folder where the APK was saved).
3. Tap the APK file (e.g., `app-debug.apk`).
4. A prompt will appear asking if you want to install the app.
   - If a dialog says **"For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source"**, tap **Settings** within that dialog, then enable the toggle that says **"Allow from this source"**, then press the back button.
5. Tap **Install**.
6. Tap **Done** when the installation finishes.
7. The **Hubitat Dashboard** app is now installed. You can find it in your app drawer.

> **Note:** The "install unknown apps" permission applies only to the Files app, not to every app on your phone. This is safe.

### 7.5 Updating the App Later

When a new version of the APK is available:

1. Upload the new APK to Google Drive (it can overwrite the old one).
2. Download it to your phone.
3. Tap the APK in the Files app and tap **Install** — it will update the existing app.
4. All your group configuration and settings are preserved.

---

## 8. Android App — First-Time Setup

When you open the Hubitat Dashboard app for the first time, it will take you directly to the **Settings screen** because no hub has been configured yet.

Fill in the following fields:

| Field | What to enter | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| **Local Hub IP** | Your Hubitat hub's IP address on your home network | e.g., `192.168.1.42` — written on hub or in router's device list |
| **Maker App ID** | The App ID from the Maker API settings page | e.g., `155` |
| **Access Token** | The Access Token from the Maker API settings page | The long string of letters, numbers, and dashes |
| **Cloud Hub ID** | *(Optional)* Your hub's cloud ID, for away-from-home access | Found on Maker API page under "Cloud Access" |

**Connection Mode:**
- **Local** — Connect to your hub only on your home Wi-Fi. Use this if you only want to control your home when you're at home.
- **Cloud** — Connect through Hubitat's cloud service. Works anywhere with internet, but slightly slower.
- **Auto** — Try local first; fall back to cloud if local is unavailable. Recommended.

After entering your details:

1. Tap **Test Connection** to verify the app can reach your hub. You should see a success message.
2. Tap **Save** to save your settings.
3. The app will load your devices and take you to the dashboard.

If the connection test fails:
- Double-check your Hub IP and Access Token.
- Make sure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network as your hub (for Local mode).
- Make sure the Maker API is enabled and the Access Token matches exactly.

---

## 9. Android App — Building Your Dashboard

The Android app works similarly to the web app. Your devices are organized into groups that you create.

### 9.1 Creating a Custom Group

1. Tap the **navigation drawer** (hamburger menu ☰) or swipe from the left edge.
2. Tap the **"+"** icon or **"New Group"** button.
3. A panel will appear from the bottom of the screen.
4. Type a name for your group (e.g., `Backyard`).
5. Choose an **icon** by tapping one in the icon grid.
6. Optionally set a **Parent Group** (see [Section 9.3](#93-subgroups)).
7. Tap **Create**.

### 9.2 Adding Devices to a Group

1. Navigate to the group you want to add devices to (tap its name in the menu).
2. Tap the **Edit** button (pencil icon ✏️) in the top-right corner.
3. Tap the **"+"** or **"Add"** button that appears.
4. A device picker panel will slide up from the bottom.
5. You will see two sections:
   - **Special Tiles** — Hub Mode, Security System, time variables like Sunrise/Sunset
   - **Devices** — all devices loaded from your hub, sorted alphabetically
6. Use the **Search** field to filter devices by name or type.
7. Tap a device or special tile to add it to the group.
8. Repeat until you've added everything you want.
9. Tap the **Edit** button again (or tap outside the panel) to exit edit mode.

### 9.3 Subgroups

A subgroup is a group that appears nested inside another group. This helps organize large dashboards.

**Example structure:**
- Outdoor *(parent group)*
  - Backyard *(subgroup — add outdoor motion sensors here)*
  - Front Yard *(subgroup — add front door and gate sensors here)*
  - Garden *(subgroup — add irrigation and outdoor lights here)*

To create a subgroup:
1. Follow the steps in [Section 9.1](#91-creating-a-custom-group) to open the "Create Group" panel.
2. At the bottom, find the **Parent Group** dropdown.
3. Tap the dropdown and choose which existing group should be the parent.
4. Tap **Create**.

The new subgroup will appear under its parent in the navigation menu, indented to show the relationship.

> **Tip:** Subgroups are perfect for large homes. For example, you could have a "Upstairs" group with subgroups for each bedroom, or a "Security" group with subgroups for "Perimeter", "Motion", and "Cameras".

### 9.4 Rearranging and Removing Tiles

While in **edit mode** (pencil icon active):

- **To move a tile:** Press and hold a tile, then drag it to a new position.
- **To remove a tile:** Tap the **X** button that appears in the corner of each tile.

---

## 10. Understanding Tile Types

When you add a device, the app automatically picks the best tile type for it based on its capabilities. Here is what each tile type looks like and does:

| Tile Type | What it shows | What you can do |
|---|---|---|
| **Switch** | On/Off status with colored indicator | Tap to toggle on or off |
| **Dimmer** | On/Off plus brightness level | Tap to toggle; slider to set brightness |
| **RGBW / Color Light** | Color swatch plus brightness | Tap for full color and brightness control |
| **Contact** | Open/Closed status (door or window) | Display only — shows if open or closed |
| **Motion** | Active/Inactive status | Display only — shows if motion is detected |
| **Presence** | Present/Away | Display only — shows if a person or device is home |
| **Temperature** | Current temperature reading | Display only |
| **Lock** | Locked/Unlocked | Tap to lock or unlock (may require PIN) |
| **Button** | Button device | Tap to push the button |
| **Power Meter** | Current wattage | Display only |
| **Connector** | Virtual on/off switch | Tap to toggle — used for virtual switches that trigger automations |
| **Ring Detection** | Ring camera motion/ring event | Display only — shows last detection event |
| **Hub Mode** | Current hub mode (Home, Away, Night, etc.) | Tap to change mode |
| **HSM** | Security system arm status | Tap to arm/disarm (may require PIN) |
| **Hub Variable** | Custom text or value from hub | Display only |

> The app makes a best guess at the tile type based on the device's capabilities. You can change it manually if the guess is wrong by using the tile type picker in edit mode.

---

## 11. Syncing Between Web and Android

Your group and tile configuration can be shared between the web app and Android app.

### Exporting from the Web App
1. On the web app, open the sidebar and find the export/import option.
2. Click **Export Config**. A JSON file will be downloaded to your PC.

### Importing into Android
1. Transfer the JSON file to your phone (email it to yourself, use Google Drive, etc.).
2. In the Android app, go to **Settings**.
3. Tap **Import Config**.
4. Browse to the JSON file and select it.
5. Confirm when prompted.

### Push / Pull via Hub File Manager
Both apps support pushing and pulling the config file directly through the Hubitat hub's built-in file manager. This allows seamless sync without manually transferring files.

1. In the web app: click **Push to Hub** to save the current config to your hub.
2. In the Android app: tap **Pull from Hub** to download that config.

> This feature requires your hub's IP/login credentials if Hub Security is enabled on the hub. Enter those in the Hub File Manager Credentials section of Settings.

## 12. Troubleshooting

### "I can't see any devices after scanning"
- Confirm the Maker API app is installed and enabled on your hub.
- Check that you selected devices in the Maker API's device list (see [Section 2.2](#22-authorize-your-devices)).
- Verify the Hub IP, Maker App ID, and Access Token are entered correctly.
- Make sure your computer or phone is on the same network as the hub.

### "Tiles are not updating in real time"
- The webhook may not be configured. Set up the Post URL in the Maker API settings (see [Section 3.3](#33-configure-the-backend)).
- The dashboard will still update by polling the hub periodically even without the webhook — it just won't be instant.

### "A hub variable tile shows nothing"
- Make sure the variable is added to the Maker API's allowed variable list (see [Section 2.3](#23-authorize-hub-variables)).
- The variable name must be spelled exactly as it appears in Hubitat (it is case-sensitive).

### "I can't install the APK on my Android phone"
- Make sure you enabled "Allow from this source" for the Files app when prompted (see [Section 7.4](#74-step-4--install-with-the-files-app)).
- If the APK fails to install with "App not installed", try restarting your phone and trying again.
- If you get "Parse error", the APK file may be corrupted — try downloading it again.

### "The web app won't start on Windows"
- Make sure Node.js is installed (type `node --version` in PowerShell).
- Make sure you ran `npm install` in the `C:\HubitatDashboard` folder at least once.
- Check that `backend/config.json` exists and has your hub IP and access token filled in.
- Make sure nothing else is using ports 3001 or 5173. Run `stop.ps1` first if you're unsure.

### "The Android app says 'Connection failed' or 'Unable to reach hub'"
- Make sure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network as your hub (for Local mode).
- Double-check the Hub IP and Access Token.
- Try tapping **Test Connection** in Settings.
- If you want to use the app away from home, make sure "Allow Access via Cloud" is enabled in the Maker API and enter your Cloud Hub ID in Settings.

*This guide covers everything needed to set up and use Hubitat Dashboard from scratch. If you run into something not covered here, the most common cause is a mismatch between the Maker API settings on the hub and what is entered in the app's configuration.*
